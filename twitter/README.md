# Twitter Command Set

Interact with Twitter directly from Slack and Terminal using [Nimbella Commander](https://nimbella.com/product/commander).

## Requirements

> We're working to provide you an option to authorize this command set using your Twitter account instead of using a developer account, but it'll take time. So please use the below method for now.

We need secrets named `twitter_consumer_key`, `twitter_consumer_secret`, `twitter_access_token_key`, and `twitter_access_token_secret` to run this command set.

You can obtain them by creating an app in your [Twitter developer portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps).
