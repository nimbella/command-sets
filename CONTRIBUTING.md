### Contributing to the Nimbella Command Set Registry

We are thankful that you're taking the time to read this contribution guide, and we are excited to work with you toward a positive contribution to the project.
This document outlines the process for contributing to the project. It also provides some guidance for creating and contributing a new Nimbella Command Set.

### We welcome all contributions.

Contributions come in many different forms, not just code. Here are some quick tips:
- **Improving project documentation**: If you found a typo, just make a pull request with the fix. If you are planning to write new documentation for a command set or a command, please [open an issue first](../../issues/new/choose). This gives us a chance to provide guidance when necessary.
- **Requesting a new feature or command**: [Open a "Feature Request"](../../issues/new?template=feature_request.md) and fill out details appropriately.
- **Changing existing commands**: Please open an appropriate [issue](../../issues/new/choose) describing your proposed change before you create a pull request. This ensures consensus and allows us to work together toward positive outcomes.

### Contribution guidelines.

Please review and keep the following guidelines in mind. _If this is your first time contributing to an open source project on GitHub, we recommend this [video series](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github) to learn how to contribute._
- We have a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please review it so you are familiar with the project values.
- You agree that your contributions will be licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License](LICENSE).
- When you open a pull request with your contributions, **you are certifying that you wrote the code** in the corresponding patch pursuant to the [Developer Certificate of Origin](#developer-certificate-of-origin) included below for your reference.
- If you're contributing a new Command Set, the [guide below](#creating-a-new-command-set) wil help you get started.

### Creating a new command set

Let's create a small `greetings` command set to understand the flow.

##### 1. Fork this repo & clone it.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/<username>/command-sets
```

##### 2. Create a new directory named `greetings` inside the `command-sets` repository.

```sh
$ cd command-sets && mkdir -p greetings/packages/default
```

##### 3. Create two new files inside `greetings` to greet in Spanish & French.

```sh
$ cd greetings/packages/default && touch {hola,bonjour}.js
```

Here each file represents a command.

##### 4. Create a `commands.yaml` file inside `greetings`

This is to let Commander know about our commands & their requirements.

```sh
$ cd ../../greetings && touch commands.yaml
```

Copy & paste the below into `commands.yaml`.

```yaml
# We need to provide the raw resource link since commander fetches the code directly from here.
sourceBasePath: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nimbella/command-sets/master/greetings
commands:
  hola:
    sourcePath: /packages/default/hola.js # Path of the command relative to sourceBasePath
    description: Greet in Spanish. # Small description of the command.
    parameters:
      - name: name
        optional: true # The name parameter is not strictly required by our code.
  bonjour:
    sourcePath: /packages/default/bonjour.js
    description: Greet in French.
    parameters:
      - name: name
```

##### 5. Write code.

You can use the below code as a template & put your logic in `__command` function.

```js
/**
 * @description Greet in Spanish.
 * @param {ParamsType} params list of command parameters
 * @param {?string} commandText text message
 * @param {!object} [secrets = {}] list of secrets
 * @return {Promise<SlackBodyType>} Response body
 */
async function _command(params, commandText, secrets = {}) {
  const {name = 'contributor'} = params;

  return {
    response_type: 'in_channel', // or `ephemeral` for private response
    text: `Â¡Hola, ${name}!`
  };
}

/**
 * @typedef {object} SlackBodyType
 * @property {string} text
 * @property {'in_channel'|'ephemeral'} [response_type]
 */
const main = async (args) => ({
  body: await _command(args.params, args.commandText, args.__secrets || {}).catch(error => ({
    response_type: 'ephemeral',
    text: `Error: ${error.message}`
  }))
});
module.exports = main;

This is the code in `hola.js`.

##### 6. Specify your command set in `command_sets.yaml` file.

This will help commander install your command set by using its name. Like: `/nc csm_install greetings`.

Append this to `command_sets.yaml`:

```yaml
greetings:
  sourcePath: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nimbella/command-sets/master/greetings/commands.yaml
  description: Greet in different languages.
```
